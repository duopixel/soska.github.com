&lt;p&gt;Yes, I used to write regularly in bloig-form for almost 6 years starting in 2004 and then I stopped. I’ve been wanting for a while to write again and use that writing to re-launch my online presence but I can’t get myself to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most terrifying part is that I need to write in English this time, instead of my native Spanish and and I don’t feel very confident doing that. Don’t get me wrong: I’m already a lousy writter in my native language, but at least I have several decades of practice. Even then, it was the lack of relevancy of writting in Spanish was one of the things that made me stop almost a decade ago. I love my language but English is the norm in the tech space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason I stopped blogging is that I was sick of WordPress. It is true that developing WP themes and plugins put food on my table for many years but, ugh, it’s like when you work on a pizzeria for a while and hate pizza thereafter. Maybe I’ll reacquire a taste for dynamic PHP CMS but in the mean time this blog is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gatsbyjs.com&quot;&gt;powered by Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it was the rise of social media (Twitter, Facebook) that made me think that I didn’t need a blog after all. Now social media is broken and toxic and I realized that a blog is still an options so here I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, maybe you’re figuring out that this nonsensical post is basically a glorified lorem ipsum. I’m so sorry. I promise I’ll write a real blog post next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
